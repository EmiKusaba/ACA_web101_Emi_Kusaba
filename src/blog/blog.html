        <h3>Disney World at the Animal Kingdom</h3>
        <h5>25.09.2018 - 25.09.2018</h5>
        My mum and I were looking forward to riding the Avatar Flight of Passage.
        It had really good reputation from reviewers!
        We weren’t able to get fast passes because it is a really popular attraction.
        To get in line, we reached the Animal kingdom at 9am just on time for the opening.
        There were so many people even though it was not a school holiday.
        I was wondering if the kids were absent from school?

        The nature scenery was wonderful!
        It was like creative nature art. There were tropical trees and flowers around the Avatar Flight of Passage— it
        reminded me of the Botanic gardens in Singapore.

        <h3>Disney World (The French Quoter Hotel and Magic Kingdom)</h3>
        <h5>23.09.2018 - 24.09.2018</h5>
        My mum is big fan of Disneyland. I imagined one day she would say “I wanna go to Disney World." So, it was dream
        come true for her on the 24th to 29th Sep 2018.
        There were a lot of preparation before we got to the theme park.
        I learnt so much I could almost become a tour guide of Disney World.

        I highly recommend to reserve restaurants, fast passes, and plan where to go beforehand.
        Especially, if you go to the park in the summer! It was hard to think properly and stand in line in around 35 °C
        heat. The fast pass is really cool to get because you get stand in a shorter line for a ride. You need to get
        different fast passes for each ride, but you can only get 3 per day.

        <h3>Houston</h3>
        <h5>20.09.2018 - 22.11.2018 </h5>
        Houston is actually close to Austin and is the biggest city in Texas.
        My husband and I decided to go to Houston on my husband’s birthday.
        We managed to book the Mega Bus from Austin to Houston. It took 3 hours.
        We booked the seats on the 2nd story. The scenery was great from there.
        I saw the beautiful Colorado River, farms, and nature from the bus.

        <h3>New York City</h3>
        <h5>10.09.2018 - 16.09.2018 15 °C</h5>
        It is getting cooler these days. I was lucky to go with my husband for to his business trip to NYC.
        Actually It was my second time visiting there. Still I was very excited to visit.
        So I skipped main sightseeing places in NYC such as the Statue of Liberty and the Modern Museum of Art, etc.
        this time because I already visited there last time.
        This time I visited many popular cafes.
        Before I visited I searched online. There are a lot of cafes in NYC and they also change quite frequently.

        <h3>Las Vegas Nevada</h3>
        <h5>06.09.2018 - 10.09.2018</h5>
        My husband and I needed a relaxing vacation after we moved to Texas.
        We decided to go to Las Vegas for the following reasons:

        ✴︎We wanted to go to a convenient city. (Because we are not used to driving yet.)
        ✴︎For the shopping, the variety of food, and the Casino.
        ✴︎The adventure to Grand Canyon…etc

        It was 4 days trip.
