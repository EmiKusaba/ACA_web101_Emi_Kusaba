        <h3 class="title">WHY HOUNDSTOOTH?</h3>
        <p>Scottish legend holds that Houndstooth was one of the first simple plaids. These plaids came to serve as
          regional identities for the people of Scotland. All were all Scotsman, but each took pride in their specific
          plaid.

          Today coffee shops have become like regional identities for people. Houndstooth wants to be a part of your
          daily rhythm, or pattern. Whether your morning coffee, afternoon tea or end of the day relaxation, we hope you
          share it with us.</p>
